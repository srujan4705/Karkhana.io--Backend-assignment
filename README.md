Assignment

1.Objective
This Python script characterizes and visualizes a MÃ¶bius strip utilizing parametric conditions, computes its surface range and edge length, and approves input parameters. It illustrates parametric 3D modeling, numerical geometry, and visualization.

2.Code Structure

  The script is modular and object-oriented, encapsulated in a MobiusStrip class.
  1. Constructor (__init__)
    Accepts 3 parameters:
    R: Radius (distance from center to strip)
    w: Width of the strip
    n: Resolution (number of points used in the mesh)
   Performs input validation to ensure:
    R and w are positive numbers
    n is an integer > 1
   Generates a meshgrid (u, v) using np.linspace over:
    u ∈ [0, 2π]
    v ∈ [-w/2, w/2]
   Calls compute_surface() to generate the 3D coordinate mesh (X, Y, Z).
 2. Parametric Surface: compute_surface()
    Implements the Möbius strip equations:
    x(u,v) =(R+vcos(u/2))cos(u)
    y(u,v) =(R+vcos(u/2))sin(u)
    z(u,v) =vsin(u/2)
   Returns a 3D mesh of points that define the strip’s surface.
 3.Surface Area Calculation: surface_area()
    Computes partial derivatives
    Uses the magnitude of the cross product of these partial derivatives to estimate local area elements dA
    Applies Simpson’s Rule (scipy.integrate.simpson) twice to integrate over both parameters (u and v), yielding an approximate surface       area.
 4. Edge Length Calculation: edge_length()
    Extracts boundary edge points at v = w/2 (last row of the mesh).
    Computes pairwise distances using np.linalg.norm(np.diff(...)) and sums them to get the edge length.
 5.Plotting: plot()
    Uses matplotlib with a 3D axis (plot_surface) to visualize the Möbius strip.
    Adds the boundary edge in red for clarity.
 6. Main Block
  Demonstrates:
    Default strip creation and analysis
    Custom parameters
    Input validation with error handling

    
2. Numerical Techniques Used:
      Task	                     Method
    Surface area	     Simpson’s Rule integration
    Edge length	       Euclidean segment summation
    Derivatives	       Finite differences (gradient)


   
3.Challenges Faced
   1.Correct integration direction: Proper nesting of Simpson’s Rule was essential for accurate double integration.
   2.Parameter resolution (n): Too low a value gave rough approximations; too high increased compute time
   3.Orientation handling: Ensuring the Möbius strip’s twist was correctly modeled using the u/2 term.
   4.Edge detection: Unlike typical surfaces, a Möbius strip has only one boundary — this required careful indexing.



4.Features
  Clean, commented, modular code
  Validated input handling
  Accurate surface area and edge length approximations
  Visual output for intuitive understanding
  Demonstrates handling of non-orientable surfaces    ​


5.Improvements / Extensions
   Add export_to_obj() to save mesh for 3D printing
   Animate twist formation using matplotlib.animation
   Add a second edge (at v = -w/2) for better analysis
   Use scipy.integrate.dblquad for higher accuracy


6.OUTPUT:
  Approximate Surface Area: 1.8992
  Approximate Edge Length: 6.3396
